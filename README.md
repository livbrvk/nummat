Projects done in numerical mathematics, fall 2020

The project regarding the condition number of Hilbert matrices was an independent project.
The project regarding the neural network for the Hamiltonian function was done in a team of 3. I had the responsibility (and therefore wrote the code) for the following sections:


-Importing functions for generating unknown data batches of Hamiltonians

-Implementing functions for generating synthetic data

-Implementing the neural network

-Creating functions to be used within the network

-Creating the different optimization functions

-Creating a function for training the neural network

-Testing the model for the suggested functions

-Testing for different variables for K, h, d and tau

-Testing with Adam's gradient descent

-Testing trajectories
